Segmenting the image using ICM algorithm
=========================================

Python script for running the model on ICM algorithm is 'icm_mrf.py':

_(Note that to run it image input must be inserted in 'img' folder in root directory of the project.)_

Afterwards following code snippet can be used to run algorithm on image desired:

`python icm.py 'img_name'`

Example run:

`python icm.py 1_small.png`
