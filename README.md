Image Segmentation Using Quantum Annealing

This project hereby implements image segmentation problem as an optimization problem. To do so Markov Random Field (MRF) used.
After MRF model created two different algorithms can be run to find a solution to problem.

1 - ICM
2 - qbsolv

Refer to src folder to learn how to use related python scripts.
